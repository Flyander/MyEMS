# MyEMS

### What's MyEMS ?
MyEMS is a medical panel built with Codeigniter that allows the management, encoding and research of patients by a large number of physicians on a daily basis. The panel also includes advanced dispatch and automatic calculation of service hours. The site is primarily for use in the Roleplay community but can be adapted for larger projects. 

This open source project is still being deployed and continues to receive content updates on an ongoing basis. (http://myems.me/)
